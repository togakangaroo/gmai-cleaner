**User**: In a google project how do I create an authorized user json file that can be passed to `from_authorized_user_info`?

**ChatGPT**: To create an authorized user JSON file that can be passed to `from_authorized_user_info` in a Google Cloud project, you'll need to follow these steps:



Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project if you haven't already. Go to the GCP Console at https://console.cloud.google.com/ and create a new project or use an existing one.



Enable the APIs you need for your project. For example, if you're working with the Google Sheets API, you'll need to enable the Google Sheets API for your project. To do this, click on "APIs & Services" in the left-hand menu, then click "Enable APIs and Services" and search for the API you need. Click on it and then click "Enable".



Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Go to the "APIs & Services" section, click "Credentials" in the left-hand menu, and then click "Create credentials". Choose "OAuth client ID" from the dropdown menu.



Configure the OAuth consent screen. Select "External" or "Internal" depending on your needs, fill in the required fields, and click "Save and Continue" until you reach the end of the configuration process.



Choose the application type for your OAuth client ID. If you're working with a Python script, select "Desktop app" as the application type. Enter a name for your client and click "Create".



Download the JSON file. After creating the OAuth client ID, you should see a screen with your new client ID details. Click the "Download" button to download the JSON file containing the client ID and secret.



Obtain the access token and refresh token. You'll need to use the `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, and `google-auth-httplib2` Python libraries to obtain the access token and refresh token. Install them using pip if you haven't already:



```
`pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2
`
```



Use the following Python script to obtain the access and refresh tokens. Replace `YOUR_JSON_FILE.json` with the path to the JSON file you downloaded earlier:



```python
`import os
import google_auth_oauthlib.flow

os.environ['OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT'] = '1'

# The JSON file you downloaded from GCP Console
client_secret_file = 'YOUR_JSON_FILE.json'
scopes = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets']  # Replace this with the scopes you need

flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(client_secret_file, scopes)
credentials = flow.run_local_server(port=0)

print(f'Access Token: {credentials.token}')
print(f'Refresh Token: {credentials.refresh_token}')
`
```



Run the script. It will open a browser window asking you to authorize the app. Click "Allow" and you'll receive the access token and refresh token.



Create the authorized user JSON file. With the access token, refresh token, and client ID JSON file, create a new JSON file with the following structure:



```json
`{
  "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "refresh_token": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "scopes": ["YOUR_SCOPES"]
}
`
```



Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `YOUR_SCOPES` with the corresponding values you obtained
