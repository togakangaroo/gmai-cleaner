# ChatGPT Conversation

**User**: Write a python script that will connect to my gmail, find any emails from the past week that contain only an image with no text content, and move those to spam

**ChatGPT**: As an AI language model, I don't have access to your Gmail account, so I can't connect to it directly. However, I can provide you with a general outline of the steps you could follow to achieve your desired result. Here's a Python script that uses the Gmail API to accomplish this task:



```python
`import os
import base64
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Set the credentials to access the Gmail API
creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(os.path.expanduser('~/.credentials/gmail.json'), ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify'])

# Define the service to access Gmail API
service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)

# Define the date range to search for emails
today = datetime.today()
last_week = today - timedelta(days=7)
query = 'is:unread after:{} before:{} has:attachment filename:jpg OR filename:png'.format(last_week.strftime('%Y/%m/%d'), today.strftime('%Y/%m/%d'))

try:
    # Search for the emails
    response = service.users().messages().list(userId='me', q=query).execute()
    messages = []
    if 'messages' in response:
        messages.extend(response['messages'])
    
    # Process the emails
    for message in messages:
        msg = service.users().messages().get(userId='me', id=message['id']).execute()
        if len(msg['payload']['parts']) == 1 and msg['payload']['parts'][0]['filename'] and msg['payload']['parts'][0]['mimeType'].startswith('image'):
            # Move the email to spam
            modify_msg = {'removeLabelIds': ['INBOX'], 'addLabelIds': ['SPAM']}
            service.users().messages().modify(userId='me', id=message['id'], body=modify_msg).execute()
            print('Moved message with id: {} to spam'.format(message['id']))
except HttpError as error:
    print('An error occurred: {}'.format(error))
`
```



Here's what the script does:



First, it sets the credentials to access the Gmail API. You'll need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console, enable the Gmail API for the project, and create a set of OAuth2 credentials that have access to the Gmail API.



Next, it defines the service to access the Gmail API.



Then it defines the date range to search for emails. The script looks for emails from the past week that are unread, have attachments, and the attachment is an image file (JPG or PNG).



The script searches for the emails that match the query.



Finally, the script processes the emails. It checks that the email has only one attachment, that the attachment is an image file, and then moves the email to the spam folder.



Note that the script only moves emails that meet all the criteria (unread, have an attachment, and the attachment is an image file) to the spam folder. If an email doesn't meet all the criteria, it will be skipped.

**User**: This assumes I have a `gmail.json` file - how do I get this?

**ChatGPT**: To get the `gmail.json` file, you will need to set up a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Gmail API for that project. Here's how you can do it:



Go to the Google Cloud Console.



Create a new project by clicking on the project dropdown at the top of the page and clicking "New Project". Give the project a name and click "Create".



Once your project is created, click on the "Navigation Menu" button (three horizontal lines in the top-left corner), then click on "APIs & Services" and then "Dashboard".



Click on the "Enable APIs and Services" button.



Search for "Gmail API" and click on the Gmail API tile.



Click the "Enable" button to enable the Gmail API.



Click on the "Create credentials" button, then select "OAuth client ID".



Choose "Desktop app" as the application type, and give your OAuth client a name.



Click the "Create" button.



Once you've created the credentials, you'll be able to download the client secrets file. Click on the "Download" button to download the JSON file containing your credentials.



Rename the JSON file to `gmail.json` and save it in a secure location on your local machine.



Once you have the `gmail.json` file, you can use it to authenticate your Python script and access the Gmail API.
